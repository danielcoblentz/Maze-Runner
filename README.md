# Maze-Runner
Robot Maze Solver
This project simulates a robot navigating through a grid-based maze using Java's Swing and Graphics2D libraries. The Robot class provides functionality for the robot to explore the maze, detect doors, and move through them.

Features
Grid-Based Maze: The maze is represented as a grid of rooms, where each room can have up to four doors (north, south, east, west).

Robot Navigation: The robot can move through the maze, checking for doors in each direction and navigating accordingly.

Visual Representation: The maze and the robot's position are visualized using Java's Swing framework.

Backtracking Algorithm: A simple backtracking algorithm is used to navigate the maze and find a path to the destination.
